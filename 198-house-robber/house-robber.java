/**
This particular problem and most of others can be approached using the following sequence:

Find recursive relation
Recursive (top-down)
Recursive + memo (top-down)
Iterative + memo (bottom-up)
Iterative + N variables (bottom-up)

robbery of current house + loot from houses before the previous
loot from the previous house robbery and any loot captured before that
rob(i) = Math.max( rob(i - 2) + currentHouseValue, rob(i - 1) )
