/**The findMaxAverage method takes two parameters: an integer array nums and an integer k. It aims to find the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length k within the nums array.

Initialize a variable sum to keep track of the sum of the first k elements in the array. This is done in a for loop that iterates through the first k elements of the array.

Initialize a variable max to store the maximum sum of k elements seen so far. Initially, it is set equal to sum.

Iterate through the array starting from index k. In this loop, you update sum by adding the current element and subtracting the element k positions earlier. This simulates the sliding window technique, where you maintain a window of size k and slide it through the array.

In each iteration of the loop, update max with the maximum value between the current max and the updated sum. This keeps track of the maximum sum of k elements encountered so far.

After processing the entire array, return the maximum average, which is max divided by k. By dividing by 1.0, you ensure that the result is a double value.

The code effectively finds the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length k by using a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of subarrays and keep track of the maximum sum encountered. */
