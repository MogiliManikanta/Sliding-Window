/***A one pass solution can be done using pointers. Move one pointer fast --> n+1 places forward, to maintain a gap of n between the two pointers and then move both at the same speed. Finally, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be n+1 places behind - just the right spot for it to be able to skip the next node.

Since the question gives that n is valid, not too many checks have to be put in place. Otherwise, this would be necessary.
